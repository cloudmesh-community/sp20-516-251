**Introduction**

The company has engineered every inch of the 707,244-square-foot facility for maximum efficiency.


**Electricity Cost and Carbon Footprint** 

The average commercial electricity rate in Northlake, IL is 4.05Â¢/kWh.[1]There are three 66 MVA electrical substations that provide a total of 198 megawatts of power.[2] 

198 megawatts * 1000 = 198000 kilowatts

Yearly Cost($) = Eelectricity Cost * IT Load(KW) = 0.0405*198000*365*24=$70,246,440.00

Based on the yearly cost, we use the carbon footprint calculator [link](
